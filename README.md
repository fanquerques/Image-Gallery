# Image-Gallery
This is an image gallery page that displays pictures specified in a file (images1.txt). 
Each picture in the file has information on how long it will be displayed before automatically transitioning to the next image, 
provided that the user does not click the "Previous" or "Next" button. 
Once the last picture is displayed, the first picture in the list is shown next, and the last picture precedes the first one.

The user can navigate the pictures using the "Previous" and "Next" buttons to show the previous or next picture in the list, respectively. 
In addition, the user can use the "Update" button to load and refresh the picture list from a different file (images2.txt). 
The application will then display the first picture in the updated list.
